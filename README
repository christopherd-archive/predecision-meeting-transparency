Overview

This repository contains a model ordinance establishing standardized, time-bound public disclosure of meetings between public officials and interested parties prior to governmental decisions.

The goal is to improve public trust by documenting who meets with decision-makers and when, without restricting lawful speech, advocacy, or association.

What This Model Does

Requires disclosure of certain meetings within a defined timeframe
Flags meetings occurring shortly before votes or decisions
Creates a public, searchable meeting log
Applies uniformly across officials, without regard to political affiliation

What This Model Does Not Do

It does not prohibit meetings
It does not regulate speech or viewpoints
It does not allege misconduct
It does not create criminal liability
It does not require new technical infrastructure

This is a process transparency standard, not an enforcement or punitive framework.

Intended Use

This ordinance is designed as a model for local governments and may be adapted by jurisdictions to align with local charters, state law, and administrative practices.

Legal review and tailoring by local counsel is expected prior to adoption.
