Implementation Notes

Purpose

These notes are provided to assist local governments, clerks, ethics officers, and legal counsel in evaluating the administrative feasibility and proper application of the Enhanced Pre-Decision Meeting Transparency Ordinance.

This document is explanatory only and does not carry independent legal force.

Administrative Feasibility

This ordinance is designed to operate using existing administrative structures and recordkeeping practices.

Most jurisdictions already maintain:
- Official calendars or schedules for elected officials
- Public records portals or document repositories
- Clerks or ethics officers responsible for records publication

No new department, board, or technical platform is required to implement this model.

Meeting Log Publication

The public meeting log may be implemented using:
- An existing city website page
- A downloadable table or spreadsheet
- An open data portal, if already in use

The ordinance does not mandate specific software, vendors, or formats beyond basic searchability and public access.

Disclosure Scope Clarification

A meeting is subject to disclosure if public business, governmental action, policy, regulation, contracts, permits, or official decision-making is discussed, regardless of setting, format, or label.

A meeting does not become exempt solely because it is described as:
- Personal
- Informal
- Social
- Casual
- Unscheduled
- Private

If public business is discussed, the meeting is subject to disclosure.

Exemptions and Justified Non-Disclosure

Exemptions are intentionally narrow and must be applied conservatively.

Whenever an exemption or delayed disclosure is applied, a written justification should be retained internally.

Examples of justified exemptions may include, but are not limited to:
- Active emergency response or disaster coordination
- Communications protected by attorney-client privilege
- Personnel matters involving confidential employment actions
- Ongoing criminal or civil investigations
- Negotiations where premature disclosure would materially harm the public interest
- Matters restricted from disclosure by state or federal law
- Communications involving legally protected personal or medical information

Exemptions must not be based on:
- Reputational concerns
- Political sensitivity
- Anticipated public reaction
- Preference for privacy
- General claims of confidentiality without a legal basis

Disclosure of Investigatory Meetings

Meetings related to ongoing criminal or civil investigations may qualify for limited exemption with respect to content, but not existence.

The occurrence of such meetings should be disclosed in the public meeting log with:
- Date of meeting
- Duration
- Participants or participating offices
- General subject matter category identified as investigative or law enforcement related

Specific details regarding evidence, strategy, investigative targets, witnesses, charges, or legal theories should not be disclosed where disclosure would compromise an active investigation or violate applicable law.

Investigatory meetings should not be omitted entirely from disclosure unless expressly prohibited by law.

Exemptions in such cases apply to content, not to the fact that the meeting occurred.

When content is withheld, a written justification should indicate:
- The legal basis for limited disclosure
- Whether the exemption is temporary or ongoing

Delayed disclosure of additional information is encouraged once disclosure no longer poses legal or investigative risk.

Confidential Subject Matter Clarification

The presence of confidential, sensitive, or classified subject matter does not, by itself, justify omission of a meeting from disclosure.

Meetings involving confidential subject matter should be disclosed at a level of generality sufficient to acknowledge the meeting’s occurrence without revealing protected details.

Acceptable disclosure examples include:
- National security meeting related to ongoing Middle Eastern conflicts
- Law enforcement meeting related to an active criminal investigation
- Legal consultation regarding pending litigation
- Personnel meeting regarding confidential employment matters

Unacceptable disclosure practices include:
- Complete omission of a meeting solely due to sensitivity
- Use of vague descriptors such as “private meeting” or “confidential discussion” without context
- Overly specific descriptions that reveal operational details, intelligence activities, investigative targets, or protected information

The guiding principle is that the existence, timing, and participants of a meeting are presumptively public, while sensitive substance may be described at an appropriately high level of abstraction when required by law or public safety.

Confidentiality applies to details, not to the fact that a meeting occurred.

Enforcement Approach

Enforcement is administrative rather than punitive.

The model relies on:
- Written notice of noncompliance
- Required corrective disclosure
- Existing ethics or administrative penalty frameworks

No criminal penalties are created by this ordinance.

Local Legal Review

Local counsel is expected to:
- Align definitions with state open records and ethics laws
- Adjust terminology to match local charters or codes
- Confirm compatibility with existing disclosure requirements

This model is intended to be adapted with care, not adopted verbatim without review.

Intent Clarification

This ordinance is intended to improve transparency of governmental process.

It does not:
- Allege wrongdoing
- Imply improper motive
- Restrict lawful advocacy or speech
- Prevent meetings between officials and the public

Transparency of process should not be interpreted as a presumption of misconduct.
